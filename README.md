# EEPROM
Open Source Arduino-based EEPROM Programmer

# About
Read and program EEPROM by using the free and open source [Arduino® programming environment](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). An [Arduino® Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano) is utilized as a programmer as well as a serial interface, that can be either accessed directly via a serial monitor (like [putty](https://www.putty.org/) or the monitor included in the Arduino IDE) or via a [Python](https://www.python.org/) GUI.

The programmer supports parallel EEPROM in PDIP-28 Package with up to 256kB of memory, like for instance:
* Microchip (Atmel) 28C64: 64kB EEPROM
* Microchip (Atmel) 28C256: 256kB EEPROM

# What's next?
Further improvements and additions to the already existing schematic desings and software will be implemented:
* Support for serial EEPROM
* Support for .bin and .hex files, additionally Intel Hex Format
